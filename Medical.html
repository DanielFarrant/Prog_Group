            <p>Medical technology is any piece of technology which can aid the lives of people suffering from from
                a range of ailments. This can include psychological and physical conditions, and is currently being
                used (or developed) to either diagnose, monitor or treat almost every medical issue that affects us.
                Medical technology can encompass things such as latex gloves, plasters, even scalpels, but I will
                primarily focus on the more high-tech applications of medical technology which tie more into
                computer science.

            <h3>Overview of medical technology</h3>
            <p>The applications of medical technology are extremely prevalent, there are very few people in the modern
            world who haven't at some point been influenced by it's impact. These range from things such
            as x-rays, to pacemakers and replacement limbs. There are a large variety of applications which are
            made with the purpose of extending and improving the quality of people's lives. Things such as diagnosis
            of diseases through analysing blood samples are also things only possible due to the presence of
            medical technology.</p>

            <h3>The Future</h3>
            <p>In the future we can only expect the applications of medical technology to become more diverse,
            by the end of our lifetimes there will be extremely significant improvements on currently existing
            technology and new technology to tackle old and new health problems. In the past 100 or so years
            blood types were discovered, penicillin was discovered, the first liver transplant occurred. People
            in the future will look back on the technology we use now and be surprised at how little we were
            able to do.</p>

            <p>Some of the ideas that we may eventually see used in the future are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Solutions to aging</li>
                <li>Ways to alter the human genome</li>
                <li>Home scanners which can be read by doctors remotely</li>
                <li>Growing organs from stem cells</li>
                <li>Advancements in exoskeletons for patients with paralysis</li>
